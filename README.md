# Fluidized Particle #

This is a program to open a webcam and track a colored ping-pong ball
in a column of air as per the article 
[Statistical Mechanics of a Gas-Fluidized Particle](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v427/n6974/full/nature02294.html) 
by Ojha, Lemieux et al, 5 Feb 2004.

In an attempt to bring this Nature-worthy article into the classroom on a budget,
we are attempting to track the motion of a ping-pong ball using color-keying and 
a webcam.
